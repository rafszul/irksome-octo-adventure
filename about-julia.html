                            <p>Would you like to get through your separation in a way that feels as fair as possible and puts the needs of your children at the very centre of discussions?</p>
                            <p>Mediation can facilitate decision-making after separation to help reduce stress and conflict. Traditional court-based processes mean that decisions may be taken out of your hands and costs can spiral out of control. Your efforts to maintain a good working relationship can be seriously undermined by what is essentially an adversarial process. Much of what needs to be done after separation is practical and financial, and you understand better than anyone what your family needs. In mediation you can retain the autonomy to find solutions that are right for you.</p>
                            <p>Having worked as a family lawyer in London for nearly two decades, I understand the legal process and I recognise its limitations as a way of resolving family disputes. I have seen some people virtually destroyed by out-of-control conflict, whilst others were able to work positively and patiently to get things right for their family at the end of their relationship. I now choose to mediate because I see that for most people it is a better way of getting through divorce.</p>
                            <p>Being able to work constructively with the emotional dynamics that can otherwise derail negotiations is one of the great strengths of mediation. Facilitated discussions can often help to unlock the conflict and improve communication for the future. The mediation process is flexible, going at the speed that is right for you.The costs will vary, depending on the complexity of your situation, but mediation is cost-effective compared with the alternatives. I work with financial advisers, therapists, family consultants, lawyers and other mediators to bring you the expertise and support you need.</p>
